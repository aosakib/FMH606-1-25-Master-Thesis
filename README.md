Summary: 
A comprehensive GIS-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework for identifying optimal location and configuration for the Energy Island. 
This framework involves a systematic combination of geospatial data processing and decision support methodologies to evaluate and rank potential sites for Energy Island in Norway and Denmark. 

The datasets include solar photovoltaic irradiance, wind speed at 100m from the Global Solar and Global Wind Atlas, along with land cover classification and transmission infrastructure data.
This framework demonstrates standardization, reclassification and weighted linear combination to synthesize multi-criteria layers, enabling transparent and feasible site selection. 
Clustering high-potential regions is calculated with DBSCAN, while KDTree is utilized to estimate proximity-based scores and cluster density. Marine Protected Area (MPA) is also integrated to assess the environmental impact to get a refined optimal location for the Energy Island. 
The study shows Norway and Denmark both have several optimal locations for Energy Island, but Denmark has three different clusters which exhibit more dense potential MCDA score sites. 


Maximum total produced energy from the best scored optimal site for Denmark is 672.5 MWh, and for Norway it is 297.90 MWh, where Solar cell capacity is 50 kWp and five wind turbines is considered. 
This framework demonstrates GIS-MCDA integration for planning and policy formulation for large-scale Energy Island configuration. 
This methodology allows additional criteria for MCDA analysis and allows more structured decisions for the implementation of long-term renewable structure installation.
